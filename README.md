# DeathCertificates
R code for working with death certificate data.
I've been working with Abie Flaxman at the the Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation (IHME)
to see if I can create a Naive Bayes machine to predict the Cause of Death (CoD) for patients
when I have basic death certificate information for them.   This GitHub repository is the result
of my work for the last several months.   Its mostly just scripting files and some results
as I go about analyzing the data.  Key files include:

GC Methods.R

DeathCertificates_Basic_Data_Shaping_and_Storage.R

DeathCertificates via Bayes for paper v1.0.R

DeathCertificates via Bayes for paper v0.5.R
