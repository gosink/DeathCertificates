Questions / comments for Abie

* Why are Stillbirths '_sb' in the "icd_name" column spelled out in particular?
* 
* What is the 'conc' field  in  'mccd final_070311.csv'
* What is 'foliocer' in  'Mexico_base de CD con 1638 registros.xls'
* Why are the gs_text descriptors different from the icd_name descriptors
* Perhaps overriding the previous, which version (ICD-9, ICD-10) are these codes?  
I might be looking at things wrong but they don't seem to exactly match up with ICD codes
that I downloaded from CMS.
